# Web Socket &bull; Protocol

Document describing the web-socket protocol.

## Opening a Connection

Opening a connection to the web-socket server is pretty straightforward. The following headers\* must be supplied.

```
Authorization: Password matching the obsidian.yml file**
User-Id: The user id of the bot you're playing music with
Client-Name: Name of your bot or project**
Resume-Key: The resume key (like lavalink), however this is only needed if the session needs to be resumed.
```

## Close Codes

| Close Code | Reason                                               |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 4001       | Invalid or missing authorization                     |
| 4002       | Missing `Client-Name` header or query-parameter      |
| 4003       | Missing `User-Id` header or query-parameter          |
| ~~4005~~   | ~~A session for the supplied user already exists.~~  |
